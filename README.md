# Project Overview
For this project, you will use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder.

# Business Problem
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

# Business Understanding
### Initiative
 Microsoft is seeking to venture into the film industry and wants to create a new movie studio and original video content. 

### Challenge
 Lack of experience and knowledge in movie creation. 

### Goal:
Identify successful film types to guide Microsoft’s new movie studio.


### Personal Objective
1. To analyze current box office trends and generate actionable insights for Microsoft’s new movie studio

# Data Understanding and Analysis
## Sources of data
In the folder zippedData are movie datasets from:
Box Office Mojo - bom.movie_gross.csv
IMDB - im.db
Rotten Tomatoes 
TheMovieDB
The Numbers

## Description of the data
Two data sources were used for this data analysis namely the Box Office Mojo and IMDB database, due to time constraints for the project. 

### Data cleaning and preprocessing

Original title column – 0.014% (21 /773,855)
Genres column – 3.7% (5408/773,855)

Box office movies 
Studio  5/3386 (0.15%)
domestic_gross   28/3386 (0.8%)
foreign_gross  1350/3386 (40%)
